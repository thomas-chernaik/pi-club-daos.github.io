    <h2>Procedural Grass</h2>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>For this project I wanted to make grass similar to how grass works in some AAA games, using real geometry for each blade.
            There are two stages to the grass generation. The first stage is in a compute shader which calculates a location and rotation for each blade.
            Then a stage in the surface shader calculates sway, lighting, colour, and if the blade is flattened by an object. 
            The final result is optimized enough that it runs at over 100 fps with 500000 visible blades, which I am very happy with.

    <h2>Procedural Animation</h2>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p> To further my interest in procedural animation I decided to design a project which would develop the skillset. This took the form of a procedurally animated
            "tentacle monster" which can move around with convincing animation. I calculate new feet positions randomly in the direction of velocity so
            that a minimum number of tentacles are always in spawn. When feet reach a certain distance from the centre, they despawn, leading to new ones spawing.
            In order to have the tentacles convincingly spawn and despawn, I made a script to shrink the mesh. This is in the form of a compute shader which
            clips the mesh down to the required size. By the end of my project I had produced a monster-character with convincing animation that can be player controlled.

    <h2>FABRIK</h2>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p> Following the procedural animation project, I decided to create my own FABRIK implementation for unity, having initially used another implementation. 
            I then tested the FABRIK implementation with a simple procedurally animated cat.

    <h2>Peer to Peer multiplayer</h2>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p> I decided to set myself the challenge of designing a simple multiplayer system, as multiplayer is part of many of the biggest modern games.
            I wanted to use a udp peer to peer system, as this would require me to write code to communicate over the internet, but wouldn't require usage of external hosting. 
            In the end, I successfully completed a peer to peer system in unity, as you can see in the video before
            where the two clients communicate across the local network. The black cube is controlled by the left client and the white cube is controlled by the right client

    <h2>Slime mould simulation</h2>
    <div class="maintext">
        <p>I began this project after watching this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A&t=936s">youtube video in which a similar project is made.</a>
            It also helped me to develop a new skillset, as this was my first time using HLSL or compute shaders.
            There are two main steps: A step in which the direction of each spore is calculated, and a step in which
            the trails of the spores diffuse. Once I implemented these, I added the ability to influence the patterns
            of the spores with an image.
